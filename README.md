# MNIST-Project
Supervised Deep Learning model trainer written in C++ for handwritten digit recognition. Uses MNIST Database for training and testing. The current pre-trained 4-layer model achieves almost 94% accuracy on the test set.

Begin by downloading the MNIST Dataset [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Altering model parameters can be edited directly in code, but weights and biases must be recalculated.
